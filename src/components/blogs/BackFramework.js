          <b>Benefits:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The MVC Architecture in CakePHP effectively divides the
              application into three separate components, streamlining
              maintenance and enhancing scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              With Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), developers can interact with
              databases through PHP code, leading to a faster and less
              error-prone development process.
            </li>
            <li>
              CakePHP includes a handy code generation tool that automates CRUD
              (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database tables,
              saving valuable time and effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The framework offers a range of built-in tools and plugins that
              bolster authentication, authorization, and security measures. This
              robust security approach safeguards against threats like CSRF
              (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and ensures user privacy and data
              confidentiality.
